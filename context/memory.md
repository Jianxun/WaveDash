# Project Memory

## Project Overview
The project aims to build a modern, web-based dashboard for visualizing simulation data from SPICE/Ngspice ".raw" files (Project "WaveDash"). This tool will replace older desktop applications like GTKWave, offering a browser-based UI, Plotly/Dash interactivity, and shareable HTML exports. The backend will be Python, leveraging libraries like `spicelib` for parsing and `numpy/pandas` for data manipulation.

## Current State
**ðŸŽ‰ MVP COMPLETED + PROFESSIONAL STYLING** âœ… - All core functionality is implemented, tested, and working end-to-end with a beautiful modern UI! WaveDash is now a fully functional SPICE waveform visualization tool with:
- Complete file upload and parsing pipeline (SPICE .raw files)
- Interactive signal selection with type classification
- 4 clickable plot tiles with active tile selection
- Real-time plotting with Plotly integration
- Full end-to-end workflow: Upload â†’ Select Signal â†’ Select Tile â†’ Plot â†’ Interact
- **Professional sidebar/main canvas layout with independent scrolling**
- **Modern UI design with gradients, shadows, and interactive feedback**
- **Responsive design supporting different screen sizes**
- 41 passing tests covering all functionality
- Professional user interface with visual feedback and error handling

**Application is ready for production use** with a polished, modern web interface that properly implements the discussed sidebar and main canvas layout.

**Next Steps**: Optional Phase 5 styling improvements or additional features beyond MVP scope.

## Key Decisions
- Build a new application (WaveDash) using Python, Dash, and Plotly.
- Leverage `spicelib` for parsing `.raw` files.
- Adopt a phased development approach, starting with an MVP as defined in `WaveDash_MVP_PRD.md`.
- **MVP Interaction Model**: Implement a click-to-select signal, click-to-select active plot tile, and a button-to-plot mechanism, deferring drag-and-drop functionality.
- Key MVP features include: `.raw` file upload and parsing, display of available signals, and plotting selected signals to user-selected tiles on a dashboard.

## Architectural Decisions (MVP)
- **Data Storage**: Pandas DataFrame with time as index, signals as columns
- **Plot Tiles**: 4 fixed tiles arranged vertically to test scrolling behavior
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling implemented for file upload and parsing
- **Performance**: No decimation needed for small datasets
- **UI/UX**: Use common practices for layout and browser compatibility
- **Project Structure**: Modular architecture with separate components, callbacks, and data modules
- **Data Stores**: Use dcc.Store for parsed-data, signal-list, selected-signal, active-tile, and tile-config
- **Plotting**: Use go.Scattergl for performance
- **File Upload**: Base64 encoding/decoding with temporary file handling for spicelib compatibility

## Technical Implementation Details
### File Upload & Parsing Flow
1. User uploads .raw file via dcc.Upload component
2. File content is base64 encoded by Dash
3. Upload callback decodes content and creates temporary file
4. spicelib.RawRead parses the temporary file
5. Data is extracted and converted to Pandas DataFrame format
6. DataFrame and signal list are stored in dcc.Store components
7. User receives feedback on success/failure with detailed messages

### Data Structure
- **parsed-data-store**: Contains DataFrame as dict with metadata
- **signal-list-store**: List of signal names for selection interface
- Independent variable (time/frequency) stored as DataFrame index
- Complex signals converted to magnitude for plotting compatibility

## Open Questions (Post-MVP Focus)
- What are the specific performance requirements and optimization strategies for "huge-file handling"?
- How will user configurations (e.g., plot preferences, themes) be managed?
- Is real-time/streaming data from `libngspice` a requirement for future versions, and what would be the technical approach?
- What is the detailed long-term testing strategy (e.g., E2E, performance benchmarks, automated visual regression)?
- What is the planned deployment strategy for wider use (e.g., Docker, PaaS)?
- How will advanced features like math traces, FFT, and synchronized zoom/pan be integrated architecturally?
- What level of extensibility (e.g., plugin system for custom math operations or plot types) is desired?
