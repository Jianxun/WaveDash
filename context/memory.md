# Project Memory

## Project Overview
The project aims to build a modern, web-based dashboard for visualizing simulation data from SPICE/Ngspice ".raw" files (Project "WaveDash"). This tool will replace older desktop applications like GTKWave, offering a browser-based UI, Plotly/Dash interactivity, and shareable HTML exports. The backend will be Python, leveraging libraries like `spicelib` for parsing and `numpy/pandas` for data manipulation.

## Current State
**ðŸŽ‰ MVP COMPLETED + PROFESSIONAL STYLING** âœ… - All core functionality is implemented, tested, and working end-to-end with a beautiful modern UI! WaveDash is now a fully functional SPICE waveform visualization tool with:
- Complete file upload and parsing pipeline (SPICE .raw files)
- Interactive signal selection with type classification
- 4 clickable plot tiles with active tile selection
- Real-time plotting with Plotly integration
- Full end-to-end workflow: Upload â†’ Select Signal â†’ Select Tile â†’ Plot â†’ Interact
- **Professional sidebar/main canvas layout with independent scrolling**
- **Modern UI design with gradients, shadows, and interactive feedback**
- **Responsive design supporting different screen sizes**
- 41 passing tests covering all functionality
- Professional user interface with visual feedback and error handling

**Application is ready for production use** with a polished, modern web interface that properly implements the discussed sidebar and main canvas layout.

**Next Steps**: Optional Phase 5 styling improvements or additional features beyond MVP scope.

## Key Decisions
- Build a new application (WaveDash) using Python, Dash, and Plotly.
- Leverage `spicelib` for parsing `.raw` files.
- Adopt a phased development approach, starting with an MVP as defined in `WaveDash_MVP_PRD.md`.
- **MVP Interaction Model**: Implement a click-to-select signal, click-to-select active plot tile, and a button-to-plot mechanism, deferring drag-and-drop functionality.
- Key MVP features include: `.raw` file upload and parsing, display of available signals, and plotting selected signals to user-selected tiles on a dashboard.

## Architectural Decisions (MVP)
- **Data Storage**: Pandas DataFrame with time as index, signals as columns
- **Plot Tiles**: 4 fixed tiles arranged vertically to test scrolling behavior
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling implemented for file upload and parsing
- **Performance**: No decimation needed for small datasets
- **UI/UX**: Use common practices for layout and browser compatibility
- **Project Structure**: Modular architecture with separate components, callbacks, and data modules
- **Data Stores**: Use dcc.Store for parsed-data, signal-list, selected-signal, active-tile, and tile-config
- **Plotting**: Use go.Scattergl for performance
- **File Upload**: Base64 encoding/decoding with temporary file handling for spicelib compatibility

**PROJECT STATUS: MVP COMPLETE AND COMMITTED** ðŸš€

## Enhancement: Multi-Signal Overlay Plotting âœ… COMPLETED
**Major Feature Enhancement**: Implemented signal comparison through overlay plotting - signals now append to tiles instead of overwriting, enabling crucial waveform comparison functionality.

### Key Enhancements Implemented:
1. **Multi-Signal Tile Support**: Tiles can now display multiple overlaid signals for comparison
2. **Signal Appending Logic**: Plot button adds signals to tiles instead of overwriting existing plots  
3. **Clear Tile Functionality**: Added "Clear Active Tile" button to remove all signals from a tile
4. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: 
   - Tile status shows signal count and names for multiple signals
   - Different colors for each signal in overlay plots
   - Legend display for multi-signal plots
   - Warning annotations for missing signals
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Handles migration from old single-signal format to new multi-signal format
6. **Improved Button States**: Dynamic button text and styling based on context

### Technical Implementation:
- **Data Structure Change**: tile-config-store now supports `{tile_id: [signal_list]}` instead of `{tile_id: signal_name}`
- **New Multi-Signal Plotting**: `create_multi_signal_plot_figure()` function with 10-color palette
- **Smart Axis Labeling**: Mixed units detection for different signal types
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing signals with visual warnings
- **UI Improvements**: Plot button now shows "Add" instead of "Plot", clear button for tile management

### User Experience Impact:
- **Engineering Workflow**: Users can now easily compare multiple waveforms on the same plot
- **No Manual Recreation**: Previous signal comparisons are preserved when adding new signals
- **Clear Management**: Easy removal of all signals from a tile to start fresh
- **Visual Distinction**: Each signal gets a unique color for clear identification

**All 41 tests passing** - Enhancement maintains full backward compatibility with existing functionality.

## Next Phase Discussion (Post-MVP Dashboard Evolution)
**Current Focus**: Transitioning from MVP to advanced dashboard with draggable tiles and automatic layout recreation.

### Key Requirements for Next Phase:
1. **Draggable Dashboard Implementation**: Replace static tiles with dynamic grid layout
2. **Automatic Layout Recreation**: Save/restore layouts after simulation and data reload
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: More flexible and intuitive dashboard interface

### Research Findings: Dashboard Layout Options
**Option 1: dash-draggable (MehdiChelh)**
- Mature but unmaintained (4 years old)
- Based on react-grid-layout 
- Features: draggable/resizable grids, responsive breakpoints
- Installation: `pip install dash-draggable`
- Status: Functional but potential compatibility issues

**Option 2: dash-dynamic-grid-layout (PipInstallPython)**
- Actively maintained and modern (2024)
- Based on react-grid-layout with recent updates
- Features: draggable/resizable, dynamic add/remove components, edit modes
- Installation: `pip install dash-dynamic-grid-layout`
- Status: Actively developed with community support

**Option 3: dash-resizable-panels (idling-mind)**
- Simpler split-panel approach
- Good for basic resizable layouts
- Less suitable for full dashboard grid needs

**Recommendation**: dash-dynamic-grid-layout appears to be the best option for WaveDash due to active maintenance and feature completeness.

### Automatic Layout Recreation Strategy:
1. **Layout Persistence**: Store tile configurations and signal mappings
2. **State Management**: Save user-defined dashboard layouts  
3. **Data Integration**: Automatically recreate plots when new data is loaded
4. **Session Continuity**: Restore previous dashboard state on startup

## Technical Implementation Details
### File Upload & Parsing Flow
1. User uploads .raw file via dcc.Upload component
2. File content is base64 encoded by Dash
3. Upload callback decodes content and creates temporary file
4. spicelib.RawRead parses the temporary file
5. Data is extracted and converted to Pandas DataFrame format
6. DataFrame and signal list are stored in dcc.Store components
7. User receives feedback on success/failure with detailed messages

### Data Structure
- **parsed-data-store**: Contains DataFrame as dict with metadata
- **signal-list-store**: List of signal names for selection interface
- Independent variable (time/frequency) stored as DataFrame index
- Complex signals converted to magnitude for plotting compatibility

## Open Questions (Post-MVP Focus)
### Immediate Next Phase Questions:
- Which draggable dashboard library to adopt (recommendation: dash-dynamic-grid-layout)?
- How to implement automatic layout recreation with saved tile configurations?
- What level of layout customization should be exposed to users?
- How to handle the transition from current 4-tile static layout to dynamic grid?
- Should we maintain backward compatibility with current static layout as fallback?

### Future Architecture Considerations:
- What are the specific performance requirements and optimization strategies for "huge-file handling"?
- How will user configurations (e.g., plot preferences, themes) be managed?
- Is real-time/streaming data from `libngspice` a requirement for future versions, and what would be the technical approach?
- What is the detailed long-term testing strategy (e.g., E2E, performance benchmarks, automated visual regression)?
- What is the planned deployment strategy for wider use (e.g., Docker, PaaS)?
- How will advanced features like math traces, FFT, and synchronized zoom/pan be integrated architecturally?
- What level of extensibility (e.g., plugin system for custom math operations or plot types) is desired?
