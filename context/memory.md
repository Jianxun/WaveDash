# Project Memory

## Project Overview
The project aims to build a modern, web-based dashboard for visualizing simulation data from SPICE/Ngspice ".raw" files (Project "WaveDash"). This tool will replace older desktop applications like GTKWave, offering a browser-based UI, Plotly/Dash interactivity, and shareable HTML exports. The backend will be Python, leveraging libraries like `spicelib` for parsing and `numpy/pandas` for data manipulation.

## Current State
**ðŸŽ‰ MVP COMPLETED + UI LAYOUT ISSUE RESOLVED + DEPENDENCIES STREAMLINED** âœ… - All core functionality is implemented, tested, and working end-to-end with a beautiful modern UI! The sidebar layout issue has been successfully resolved and dependencies have been cleaned up.

**Current Features:**
- Complete file upload and parsing pipeline (SPICE .raw files)
- Interactive signal selection with type classification
- 4 clickable plot tiles with active tile selection
- Real-time plotting with Plotly integration
- **Multi-signal overlay plotting** for signal comparison
- Full end-to-end workflow: Upload â†’ Select Signal â†’ Select Tile â†’ Plot â†’ Interact
- **Professional sidebar/main canvas layout working correctly**
- **Modern UI design with gradients, shadows, and interactive feedback**
- **Responsive design supporting different screen sizes**
- 41 passing tests covering all functionality
- Professional user interface with visual feedback and error handling
- **Streamlined dependency management** with clean requirements.txt

**Layout Issue Resolution:**
- **Root Cause**: CSS assets folder not being loaded due to incorrect path when running `python src/app.py`
- **Solution**: Added explicit `assets_folder` configuration in Dash app initialization and run with `python -m src.app`
- **Result**: Sidebar now correctly appears to the left of main content in horizontal flexbox layout

**Dependencies Cleanup:**
- **Previous**: 202 packages including many unnecessary sub-dependencies (pyobjc frameworks, etc.)
- **Current**: 8 core packages (dash, plotly, pandas, numpy, spicelib, pytest, requests, selenium)
- **Benefit**: Faster installation, cleaner environment, easier maintenance
- **Verification**: All 41 tests still passing

**Project Organization:**
- `/doc` - Documentation files
- `/tools` - Development and diagnostic tools 
- `/temp` - Temporary files, screenshots, and debug output
- `/raw_data` - Sample SPICE files (Ring_Oscillator_7stage.raw for testing)

**Application is ready for production use** with a polished, modern web interface that properly implements the discussed sidebar and main canvas layout.

## Key Decisions
- Build a new application (WaveDash) using Python, Dash, and Plotly.
- Leverage `spicelib` for parsing `.raw` files.
- Adopt a phased development approach, starting with an MVP as defined in `WaveDash_MVP_PRD.md`.
- **MVP Interaction Model**: Implement a click-to-select signal, click-to-select active plot tile, and a button-to-plot mechanism, deferring drag-and-drop functionality.
- Key MVP features include: `.raw` file upload and parsing, display of available signals, and plotting selected signals to user-selected tiles on a dashboard.
- **Layout Fix**: Use `python -m src.app` for proper module imports and assets loading

## Architectural Decisions (MVP)
- **Data Storage**: Pandas DataFrame with time as index, signals as columns
- **Plot Tiles**: 4 fixed tiles arranged vertically to test scrolling behavior
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling implemented for file upload and parsing
- **Performance**: No decimation needed for small datasets
- **UI/UX**: Use common practices for layout and browser compatibility
- **Project Structure**: Modular architecture with separate components, callbacks, and data modules
- **Data Stores**: Use dcc.Store for parsed-data, signal-list, selected-signal, active-tile, and tile-config
- **Plotting**: Use go.Scattergl for performance
- **File Upload**: Base64 encoding/decoding with temporary file handling for spicelib compatibility
- **Assets Configuration**: Explicit `assets_folder` path configuration for CSS loading

## Technical Resolution Details
### Sidebar Layout Issue Diagnosis and Fix
**Problem**: Sidebar appearing above main content instead of to the left
**Diagnosis Process**:
1. Created diagnostic tools to inspect layout and CSS loading
2. Discovered CSS not being loaded (display: block instead of display: flex)
3. Found that all stylesheets were "inline" with no external CSS
4. Identified assets folder path issue when running from src/ directory

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
# Added to src/app.py
current_dir = Path(__file__).parent
project_root = current_dir.parent
assets_folder = project_root / "assets"

app = dash.Dash(
    __name__,
    assets_folder=str(assets_folder)  # Explicit assets path
)
```

**Verification**: Layout diagnostic tools confirmed:
- `display: flex` now applied to app-content
- Sidebar width: 350px (correct)
- Horizontal layout: sidebar beside main content
- CSS rules properly loaded and applied

### Key Enhancements Implemented:
1. **Multi-Signal Tile Support**: Tiles can now display multiple overlaid signals for comparison
2. **Signal Appending Logic**: Plot button adds signals to tiles instead of overwriting existing plots  
3. **Clear Tile Functionality**: Added "Clear Active Tile" button to remove all signals from a tile
4. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: 
   - Tile status shows signal count and names for multiple signals
   - Different colors for each signal in overlay plots
   - Legend display for multi-signal plots
   - Warning annotations for missing signals
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Handles migration from old single-signal format to new multi-signal format
6. **Improved Button States**: Dynamic button text and styling based on context

### Technical Implementation:
- **Data Structure Change**: tile-config-store now supports `{tile_id: [signal_list]}` instead of `{tile_id: signal_name}`
- **New Multi-Signal Plotting**: `create_multi_signal_plot_figure()` function with 10-color palette
- **Smart Axis Labeling**: Mixed units detection for different signal types
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing signals with visual warnings
- **UI Improvements**: Plot button now shows "Add" instead of "Plot", clear button for tile management

### User Experience Impact:
- **Engineering Workflow**: Users can now easily compare multiple waveforms on the same plot
- **No Manual Recreation**: Previous signal comparisons are preserved when adding new signals
- **Clear Management**: Easy removal of all signals from a tile to start fresh
- **Visual Distinction**: Each signal gets a unique color for clear identification
