# Project Todo List

## Current Sprint (MVP Features)

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure âœ… COMPLETED
- [X] Initialize Git repository (if not done)
- [X] Set up Python virtual environment
- [X] Install dependencies: `dash`, `plotly`, `pandas`, `spicelib`
- [X] Create `requirements.txt`
- [X] Create main application file `src/app.py`
- [X] Implement basic Dash app layout (Header, Sidebar, Main Content areas)
- [X] Add `dcc.Store` components for:
  - [X] `id='parsed-data-store'`
  - [X] `id='signal-list-store'`
  - [X] `id='tile-config-store'` (maps tile_id to signal_name)
  - [X] `id='selected-signal-store'` (stores name of the currently selected signal)
  - [X] `id='active-tile-store'` (stores id of the currently active plot tile)

### Phase 2: File Upload and Parsing âœ… COMPLETED
- [X] Add `dcc.Upload` component to the sidebar for `.raw` files
- [X] Implement callback for `dcc.Upload` to:
  - [X] Decode uploaded file content
  - [X] Parse `.raw` file using `spicelib.RawRead`
  - [X] Extract traces and sweeps
  - [X] Construct Pandas DataFrame (index=sweep, columns=signals)
  - [X] Store DataFrame in `parsed-data-store`
  - [X] Extract and store signal names in `signal-list-store`

### Phase 3: Sidebar - Signal Selection & Plot Action âœ… COMPLETED
- [X] Add `html.Div` (e.g., `id='signal-list-display'`) to sidebar for listing signals
- [X] Implement callback to populate `signal-list-display` from `signal-list-store`
  - [X] For each signal, create a clickable HTML element (e.g., `html.Button` or styled `html.Div`)
  - [X] Implement callback for signal list items: on click, update `selected-signal-store` with the clicked signal's name
- [X] Add a "Plot to Active Tile" `html.Button` (e.g., `id='plot-button'`) to the sidebar

### Phase 4: Main Canvas - Plot Tiles & Active Tile Selection âœ… COMPLETED
- [X] Define 4 `dcc.Graph` components as plot tiles in the main content area (e.g., `id='plot-tile-1'`). Make each tile (or a wrapper Div) clickable.
- [X] Implement callback for plot tiles: on click, update `active-tile-store` with the ID of the clicked tile.
- [X] Implement callback for the "Plot to Active Tile" button (`id='plot-button'`):
  - [X] Inputs: `n_clicks` of `plot-button`, `data` from `selected-signal-store`, `data` from `active-tile-store`.
  - [X] Logic: Update `tile-config-store` to map the `selected-signal` to the `active-tile`.
- [X] Implement plotting callbacks for each `dcc.Graph` tile's `figure`:
  - [X] Input: Signal name for the tile (derived from `tile-config-store` based on the tile's ID), data from `parsed-data-store`.
  - [X] Logic: Retrieve data, create Plotly line chart (`go.Scattergl`).
  - [X] Output: Plotly figure object (or empty/placeholder if no signal assigned to the tile).

### Phase 5: Professional Styling and Layout âœ… COMPLETED
- [X] Create comprehensive CSS file in `assets/style.css` for modern UI layout
- [X] Implement proper sidebar and main canvas layout with independent scrolling
- [X] Add visual feedback for signal selection and active tile states
- [X] Style upload areas, buttons, and interactive elements with modern design
- [X] Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- [X] Add custom scrollbar styling for better UX
- [X] Ensure professional appearance with gradients, shadows, and transitions
