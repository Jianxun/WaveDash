## Current Architecture Status

### From Static MVP to Dynamic Dashboard:
**Current State**: 4 static tiles with click-to-select interaction + working sidebar layout
**Target State**: Dynamic grid with draggable tiles and automatic layout recreation

### Key Technical Decisions Made:
1. **Layout Issue**: Resolved by proper assets folder configuration
2. **Run Command**: Use `python -m src.app` for proper module imports
3. **Project Structure**: Organized into logical folders (/doc, /tools, /temp)
4. **Sample Data**: Use Ring_Oscillator_7stage.raw (not .op.raw)

### Key Technical Decisions Needed:
1. **Dashboard Library**: dash-dynamic-grid-layout (recommended)
2. **Layout Persistence**: Local storage + server-side backup
3. **Data Integration**: Seamless integration with existing signal plotting system
4. **User Experience**: Edit/view modes with intuitive drag-and-drop
5. **Migration Strategy**: Gradual transition maintaining current functionality

### Success Criteria for Dashboard Phase:
- [ ] Users can drag and resize plot tiles
- [ ] Layout configurations are automatically saved and restored
- [ ] New data loading preserves and recreates previous dashboard layout
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with dynamic layouts
- [ ] All existing MVP functionality continues to work
- [ ] Dashboard state persists across browser sessions
