## Prompt:
If nothing exists, I am ok to build one. Do you think this is a project worth undertaking? Estimate the amount of work it takes to build a web based waveform viewer like this? The stack is more modern with python so I can leverage the AI coder to assist with the implementation.

## Response:
Thought for 19 seconds

Below is a realistic **back-of-the-envelope project plan** for a browser-based waveform viewer that opens native **SPICE/Ngspice “.raw”** files and gives you Plotly-class interactivity (zoom/pan at 60 fps, dual-cursor Δ-markers, math traces, FFT, shareable HTML exports).

* * *

1\. Why it’s worth doing
------------------------

| Pain today | What a Plotly/Dash viewer would give you |
| --- | --- |
| GTK/QT viewers (GAW, GWAVE) feel dated, can’t embed in Jupyter/Obsidian, and are Mac/Wayland-awkward. | **Web-first UI** works the same on Mac, Windows, Linux—even an iPad. |
| Hard to publish results—screenshots only. | One-click “Export as standalone HTML” that colleagues can open without installing anything. |
| Limited scripting/extensibility. | **Python back-end** = zero-friction integration with your existing Ngspice + PySpice scripts, AI code-assist, and scientific Python stack. |
| No delta cursors, param sliders, live streaming from `libngspice`. | Plotly + Dash callbacks make these 100-line features, not C++ rebuilds. |

For your workflow—heavy iterative design, notebook documentation, and an AI code copilot—this is a nicely leveraged side project: small enough to finish, impactful enough to keep using.

2\. Leverage what already exists
--------------------------------

| Building block | Status | Saves you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`spicelib.RawRead`** – parses `.raw` → `numpy/pandas` in one line. | pip, LGPL-3 | Weeks of binary-format reverse-engineering [Spicelib](https://spicelib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classes/raw_read.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **`spyci`** – CLI + Python API that already plots with Matplotlib; easy to fork/extend. | MIT, 600 LOC | Reference code for unit tests & edge cases [GitHub](https://github.com/gmagno/spyci?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Plotly/Dash** – WebGL lines, shapes, events. | MIT | Production-quality front-end & server [Plotly Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/two-cursors-on-the-plotly-graph/42340?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Community snippets for **dual-cursor / oscilloscope markers**. | Forum / SO posts | Ready-made callback patterns [Plotly Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/add-cursors-for-measurment/16064?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74864878/is-there-a-way-to-make-a-oscilloscope-styled-double-cursor-delta-while-plottin?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

With these pieces, you’re wiring Lego bricks rather than pouring concrete.

3\. Feature roadmap & effort estimates
--------------------------------------

| Milestone | What’s in it | New code (≈LOC) | Time (solo, nights + weekends) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MVP (week 1–2)** | • drag-&-drop `.raw`  
• time-domain traces (WebGL)  
• zoom/pan  
• autoscale | ~250 | 1–2 wk |
| **Delta cursors & read-out (week 3)** | two fixed vertical lines, `Δt`, `ΔV` overlay | +120 | 2–3 days |
| **Math/derived traces (week 3–4)** | text box → `numexpr` eval on pandas columns | +150 | 1 wk |
| **FFT & spectrum tab** | Hanning + `numpy.fft`, log-scale Plotly trace | +120 | 3 days |
| **Huge-file handling (week 5)** | on-load decimation, lazy window streaming | +200 | 1 wk |
| **Session save / share (week 6)** | compress trace + JSON layout → standalone HTML | +100 | 3 days |
| **Polish & CI** | unit tests on spyci corpus, GitHub Actions, docs | +150 | 1 wk |

**Total** ≈ 1 500 LOC ⇒ **~6 calendar weeks** of after-hours effort, or ~3 full-time weeks.  
With AI pair-programming (Copilot, GPT-o3 tool calls) expect ~20–30 % faster.

4\. Technical architecture
--------------------------

```text
┌───────┐        .raw file        ┌────────┐
│Disk │ ───────────────▶ │   Loader │                • spicelib.RawRead
└───────┘                        └────────┘
                                     │ pandas/numpy
                                     ▼
                               ┌─────────────┐
                               │ Dash server │  ⇐ Flask + callbacks
                               └─────────────┘
                                     │ JSON over WebSocket
                                     ▼
                                Plotly.js front-end
```

*   **Performance ceiling**: Plotly WebGL holds ~2–3 M points/trace; beyond that you decimate or stream only the visible window.
    
*   **Offline mode**: Vendor Plotly JS locally, no CDN needed—fits your air-gapped Docker images.
    
*   **Extensibility hooks**: Provide a `register_math_op(fn)` API so colleagues can drop in custom measurement functions.
    

* * *

5\. Risks & mitigation
----------------------

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| **Very large raw files** (> 1 GB) choke browser memory. | Automatic down-sampling + “load window on pan” strategy. |
| Keeping FPS responsive with dozens of traces. | Use Plotly’s `scattergl`, restrict visible traces, offer “decimate to N pts/px”. |
| Feature creep (digital bus decoding, eye-diagrams). | Stick to analogue scope core; expose plug-in interface for extras later. |
| Cross-browser quirks (Safari iOS). | CI runs Playwright tests across Chrome/Firefox/Safari. |

* * *

6\. Build-vs-extend decision
----------------------------

*   **Fork `spyci` + swap Matplotlib → Plotly**: quickest path; you inherit its parser tests.
    
*   **Contribute Plotly back-end to GAW**: deeper C/GObject work, less fun.
    
*   **Fresh Dash app (recommended)**: clean Python, flexible, no historical baggage.
    

Given your scripting habits and emphasis on **AI-assisted, notebook-friendly tooling**, a fresh Dash app is likely the **highest ROI**: you get exactly the UX you want, plus a live playground to prototype AI-driven waveform analyses later (auto-annotate settling time, automatically tag glitches, etc.).

* * *

### Verdict

**Yes, it’s a project worth doing**:

*   **Scope is small enough** (≈1 500 LOC) to finish solo in 1–2 months.
    
*   **Leverages your existing Python tooling** and maximises Copilot/GPT code assistance.
    
*   Produces a **sharable, browser-native viewer** that slots neatly into your AI-augmented design flow and Obsidian knowledge base.
    

Kick it off with a weekend spike: load a `.raw`, plot one trace in Dash, and wire up two cursor lines—you’ll know in a day whether the ergonomics click. Happy hacking!
