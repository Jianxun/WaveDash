## Prompt:
What’s the best waveform viewer of SPICE simulation raw files? I prefer fully open source tools.

## Response:
Thought for 1m 26s

Below is a quick “state of the ecosystem” summary of the fully-open-source waveform viewers that can open native **SPICE/Ngspice “.raw”** files, followed by a recommendation that fits best with the tool stack you already use (Ngspice + Xschem + Docker).

* * *

### 1\. **GAW – Gtk Analog Wave viewer** _(my top pick)_

_GPL-2.0; actively maintained – last commit July 2024_

*   **Reads raw directly** (Spice2, Spice3/Ngspice), plus HSPICE, NanoSim, WAV, CSV, etc.
    
*   Unlimited panels/waves, dual-cursor Δ-measurements, log/lin axes, export to images or CSV.
    
*   Remote-control socket: Xschem can push highlighted nets straight into an open GAW window, keeping waveform colours in sync.
    
*   Builds cleanly on modern distros (GTK-3 option), or grab the patched _xschem-gaw_ fork if you want drop-in remote support. [rvq.fr](https://www.rvq.fr/linux/gaw.php)[GitHub](https://github.com/StefanSchippers/xschem-gaw)
    

**Why it’s “best” for Ngspice users:**  
GAW gives you the richest analogue-oriented UI without leaving the open-source toolchain and is still being patched by the Xschem maintainer. It handles multi-GB raw files more gracefully than older Gwaves and you don’t need format conversion as you would with GTKWave.

* * *

### 2\. **Xschem built-in “Graphs”**

_GPL; bundled with Xschem ≥ 3.0_

*   Opens the **same .raw** file directly in the schematic canvas; no external viewer needed.
    
*   Ideal for quick spot-checks while you’re iterating design/topology, but lacks multi-document management, FFT, and math libraries that GAW offers. [Repo](https://repo.hu/projects/xschem/xschem_man/graphs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

Use it for quick probes; hand the file off to GAW when you need deep inspection or scripted measurement.

* * *

### 3\. **GWAVE (original) & GAW’s predecessors**

_GPL; project dates back to 2009, minimal updates since_

*   Still compiles, but depends on Guile-GTK2; rendering performance is noticeably poorer on high-DPI monitors.
    
*   Viable on headless build boxes or if you prefer the old Guile scripting hooks. [gwave.sourceforge.net](https://gwave.sourceforge.net/)
    

* * *

### 4\. **Qucs-S Post-Processor**

_GPL; Qt-based GUI released Feb 2025_

*   Qucs-S can call Ngspice/Xyce and shows results in its own tabbed viewer.
    
*   Solid choice if you want a single integrated IDE for schematics, simulation setup and viewing, but importing an external .raw into Qucs-S is clunkier than dragging into GAW. [Qucs-S](https://ra3xdh.github.io/)
    

* * *

### 5\. **GTKWave** – only if you must mix with digital VCD/FST

_GPL; superb at huge digital traces_

*   Analog traces require converting your .raw to VCD (Ngspice `write vcd`), so it’s rarely worth the detour unless you already have a mixed-signal flow. [gtkwave.sourceforge.net](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

* * *

### 6\. **Python notebooks (PySpice, pandas, matplotlib)**

Great for scripted analysis, automation and embedding plots in reports—but not a drop-in replacement for an interactive analogue scope. [PySpice](https://pyspice.fabrice-salvaire.fr/releases/v1.4/api/PySpice/Probe/WaveForm.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

Recommended workflow for your setup
-----------------------------------

| Use-case | Fast probe | Deep interactive debug | Batch/automation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tool** | Xschem “Graphs” | **GAW (xschem-gaw fork)** | PySpice + Jupyter |

1.  **Inside Xschem**: `Ctrl-click` the green arrow ➜ the raw loads into an on-canvas graph for an instant sanity check.
    
2.  **For serious analysis**: `Simulation → Send highlighted nets to GAW` (or `Alt-G`). If you install the _xschem-gaw_ fork, this just works over a local TCP socket—no file gymnastics.
    
3.  **Automated sweeps**: Script Ngspice runs in Docker, then post-process with PySpice; export CSV/PNG for documentation or drop them back into Obsidian.
    

### One-liner install (Ubuntu 22.04 + Docker container)

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends \
        gaw xschem git pkg-config libgtk-3-dev gettext
git clone https://github.com/StefanSchippers/xschem-gaw.git
cd xschem-gaw && ./configure && make -j$(nproc) && sudo make install
```

Add to `~/.gaw/gawrc`:

```
up_listenPort = 2020
```

and to `~/.xschem/xschemrc`:

```tcl
set gaw_tcp_address {localhost 2020}
```

That’s it—Xschem and GAW now handshake automatically.

* * *

### Bottom line

*   **If you want the most polished open-source analogue viewer today, install GAW and wire it into Xschem.**
    
*   Keep the Xschem built-in graphs for quick “does my bias point make sense?” checks.
    
*   Use Python or Qucs-S only when you need programmatic post-processing or a Qt-based all-in-one IDE.
    

Happy probing!

## Prompt:
Do we have anything aligned with the more modern interactive data visualization tools such as plotly? 

How hard is it to implement features such as delta markers with plotly?

## Response:
Thought for 1m 32s

### Is there already a _Plotly-style_ open-source viewer for SPICE .raw files?

*   **Short answer:** not yet in the “double-click installer” sense.  
    The mainstream open-source viewers (GAW, Xschem-Graphs, GWAVE, Qucs-S) are still **GTK/Qt** apps written in C or C++ and draw with Cairo/QPainter, not with a browser canvas.
    
*   **Closest building blocks you can reuse today**
    

| Piece | What it gives you | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spicelib` ( `pip install spicelib` ) | Binary + ASCII parser that converts a **.raw** into `numpy`/`pandas` arrays in one line — no GUI | LGPL-3.0 [Spicelib](https://spicelib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/varia/raw_file.html) |
| `spyci` ( `pip install spyci` ) | Tiny CLI + Python API that already does `load_raw()` → Matplotlib plot. You can swap Matplotlib for Plotly in <20 lines | MIT [GitHub](https://github.com/gmagno/spyci) |
| `spiceplot` (Go) | Renders static PNG/SVG from `.raw`; demonstrates a minimal parser if you prefer Go/wasm | GPL-2.0 [GitHub](https://github.com/norcalli/spiceplot) |
| Plotly / Dash | Interactive WebGL lines, hover-tooltips, callbacks, streaming, Web-first deployment | MIT [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Dash Documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

So while nobody ships a ready-made “Plotly Oscilloscope” executable, the raw-file decoders and the interactive plotting layer you want already exist and are permissively licensed.

* * *

### DIY in ~100 lines: a minimal Dash waveform viewer

```python
import dash, dash_core_components as dcc, dash_html_components as html
import numpy as np, pandas as pd, plotly.graph_objs as go
from spicelib.raw import RawRead          # or spyci.load_raw

raw = RawRead("tran.raw")                 # ↦ dict of numpy arrays
time = raw.get_trace(0)                   # usually 0 = time axis
vout = raw.get_trace("V(out)")            # by name or index

app = dash.Dash(__name__)
app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Graph(
        id="scope",
        figure={
            "data":[go.Scatter(x=time, y=vout, mode="lines", name="V(out)")],
            "layout":go.Layout(uirevision=True)  # keeps zoom when we redraw
        },
        clear_on_unhover=True
    ),
    html.Div(id="readout")                 # will display Δt, ΔV
])

@app.callback(
    dash.Output("scope","figure"),
    dash.Output("readout","children"),
    dash.Input("scope","selectedData"),    # lasso or click-&-drag range
    prevent_initial_call=True)
def show_delta(sel):
    if sel and len(sel["points"])>=2:
        pts = sorted(sel["points"], key=lambda p:p["pointIndex"])
        t0, v0 = pts[0]["x"], pts[0]["y"]
        t1, v1 = pts[-1]["x"], pts[-1]["y"]
        Δt, Δv = t1-t0, v1-v0
        # add two vertical lines + annotation
        fig = dash.callback_context.outputs_list[0]["id"]["figure"]
        fig["layout"]["shapes"] = [
            dict(type="line", x0=t0, x1=t0, y0=min(vout), y1=max(vout),
                 line=dict(dash="dot")),
            dict(type="line", x0=t1, x1=t1, y0=min(vout), y1=max(vout),
                 line=dict(dash="dot"))
        ]
        return fig, f"Δt = {Δt:g} s ΔV = {Δv:g} V"
    return dash.no_update, dash.no_update

app.run_server(debug=True)
```

*   **Delta markers** – here we piggy-back on Plotly’s built-in _box select_ to get two x-coordinates, then draw vertical lines (`layout.shapes`) and print the deltas.
    
    *   For oscilloscope-style _track cursors_ use the lower-level `plotly_click` and `plotly_relayout` events instead; see community thread for examples [Plotly Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/add-cursors-for-measurment/16064).
        
    *   Everything is data-driven, so once you have the two x-positions the math is trivial and Plotly updates at 60 fps.
        
*   **Performance** – Plotly WebGL traces handle ~2-3 million points per trace before FPS drops. For multi-GB `.raw` files decimate on load (`scipy.signal.decimate` or take every _n_\-th sample) or stream only the visible window.
    

* * *

### Effort estimate for a _feature-parity_ viewer

| Feature | Lines of Python | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Load `.raw` → pandas | ≈10 | using `spicelib` |
| Basic Plotly line panes | ≈20 | WebGL + autoscale |
| Dual delta cursors + read-out | ≈40 | callbacks shown above |
| Math traces (`Vout – Vin`) | ≈30 | Dash `Input` for expression box, `numexpr` eval |
| Save/restore plot configs | ≈20 | browser `dcc.Store` or simple JSON |
| FFT tab | ≈30 | `numpy.fft.fft` + second Plotly graph |

Total < 200 LOC for a prototype; a weekend hack rather than a multi-month project.

* * *

### When to **prefer** Plotly/Dash over GAW

| Need | Plotly stack shines when… | GAW already covers it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publish results as HTML dashboard, embed in Obsidian, run on iPad | ✅ | ❌ |
| Live-stream data from remote ngspice (`libngspice`\-shared) | ✅ | ⚠ (possible via TCP but harder) |
| Cross-linked stats, sliders, param sweeps UI | ✅ | ❌ |
| 10-second “open file, eyeball waveform” | OK, but heavier | **GAW/Xschem-Graphs is faster** |

* * *

### Bottom line

*   **No off-the-shelf Plotly viewer yet** – but the parser and the plotting engine are there; glue them with ~200 lines of Dash.
    
*   **Delta / dual-cursor measurement** is a first-hour task in Plotly: capture two clicks, draw two `shape` lines, subtract, and annotate.
    
*   Keep **GAW inside Xschem** for quick sanity checks; spin up a Plotly/Dash app when you need interactive demos, notebook embeds, or publishable dashboards.
    

That gives you a modern, browser-native oscilloscope without waiting for a new upstream tool.

## Prompt:
If nothing exists, I am ok to build one. Do you think this is a project worth undertaking? Estimate the amount of work it takes to build a web based waveform viewer like this? The stack is more modern with python so I can leverage the AI coder to assist with the implementation.

## Response:
Thought for 19 seconds

Below is a realistic **back-of-the-envelope project plan** for a browser-based waveform viewer that opens native **SPICE/Ngspice “.raw”** files and gives you Plotly-class interactivity (zoom/pan at 60 fps, dual-cursor Δ-markers, math traces, FFT, shareable HTML exports).

* * *

1\. Why it’s worth doing
------------------------

| Pain today | What a Plotly/Dash viewer would give you |
| --- | --- |
| GTK/QT viewers (GAW, GWAVE) feel dated, can’t embed in Jupyter/Obsidian, and are Mac/Wayland-awkward. | **Web-first UI** works the same on Mac, Windows, Linux—even an iPad. |
| Hard to publish results—screenshots only. | One-click “Export as standalone HTML” that colleagues can open without installing anything. |
| Limited scripting/extensibility. | **Python back-end** = zero-friction integration with your existing Ngspice + PySpice scripts, AI code-assist, and scientific Python stack. |
| No delta cursors, param sliders, live streaming from `libngspice`. | Plotly + Dash callbacks make these 100-line features, not C++ rebuilds. |

For your workflow—heavy iterative design, notebook documentation, and an AI code copilot—this is a nicely leveraged side project: small enough to finish, impactful enough to keep using.

* * *

2\. Leverage what already exists
--------------------------------

| Building block | Status | Saves you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`spicelib.RawRead`** – parses `.raw` → `numpy/pandas` in one line. | pip, LGPL-3 | Weeks of binary-format reverse-engineering [Spicelib](https://spicelib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classes/raw_read.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **`spyci`** – CLI + Python API that already plots with Matplotlib; easy to fork/extend. | MIT, 600 LOC | Reference code for unit tests & edge cases [GitHub](https://github.com/gmagno/spyci?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Plotly/Dash** – WebGL lines, shapes, events. | MIT | Production-quality front-end & server [Plotly Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/two-cursors-on-the-plotly-graph/42340?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Community snippets for **dual-cursor / oscilloscope markers**. | Forum / SO posts | Ready-made callback patterns [Plotly Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/add-cursors-for-measurment/16064?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74864878/is-there-a-way-to-make-a-oscilloscope-styled-double-cursor-delta-while-plottin?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

With these pieces, you’re wiring Lego bricks rather than pouring concrete.

* * *

3\. Feature roadmap & effort estimates
--------------------------------------

| Milestone | What’s in it | New code (≈LOC) | Time (solo, nights + weekends) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MVP (week 1–2)** | • drag-&-drop `.raw`  
• time-domain traces (WebGL)  
• zoom/pan  
• autoscale | ~250 | 1–2 wk |
| **Delta cursors & read-out (week 3)** | two fixed vertical lines, `Δt`, `ΔV` overlay | +120 | 2–3 days |
| **Math/derived traces (week 3–4)** | text box → `numexpr` eval on pandas columns | +150 | 1 wk |
| **FFT & spectrum tab** | Hanning + `numpy.fft`, log-scale Plotly trace | +120 | 3 days |
| **Huge-file handling (week 5)** | on-load decimation, lazy window streaming | +200 | 1 wk |
| **Session save / share (week 6)** | compress trace + JSON layout → standalone HTML | +100 | 3 days |
| **Polish & CI** | unit tests on spyci corpus, GitHub Actions, docs | +150 | 1 wk |

**Total** ≈ 1 500 LOC ⇒ **~6 calendar weeks** of after-hours effort, or ~3 full-time weeks.  
With AI pair-programming (Copilot, GPT-o3 tool calls) expect ~20–30 % faster.

* * *

4\. Technical architecture
--------------------------

```text
┌───────┐        .raw file        ┌────────┐
│Disk │ ───────────────▶ │   Loader │                • spicelib.RawRead
└───────┘                        └────────┘
                                     │ pandas/numpy
                                     ▼
                               ┌─────────────┐
                               │ Dash server │  ⇐ Flask + callbacks
                               └─────────────┘
                                     │ JSON over WebSocket
                                     ▼
                                Plotly.js front-end
```

*   **Performance ceiling**: Plotly WebGL holds ~2–3 M points/trace; beyond that you decimate or stream only the visible window.
    
*   **Offline mode**: Vendor Plotly JS locally, no CDN needed—fits your air-gapped Docker images.
    
*   **Extensibility hooks**: Provide a `register_math_op(fn)` API so colleagues can drop in custom measurement functions.
    

* * *

5\. Risks & mitigation
----------------------

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| **Very large raw files** (> 1 GB) choke browser memory. | Automatic down-sampling + “load window on pan” strategy. |
| Keeping FPS responsive with dozens of traces. | Use Plotly’s `scattergl`, restrict visible traces, offer “decimate to N pts/px”. |
| Feature creep (digital bus decoding, eye-diagrams). | Stick to analogue scope core; expose plug-in interface for extras later. |
| Cross-browser quirks (Safari iOS). | CI runs Playwright tests across Chrome/Firefox/Safari. |

* * *

6\. Build-vs-extend decision
----------------------------

*   **Fork `spyci` + swap Matplotlib → Plotly**: quickest path; you inherit its parser tests.
    
*   **Contribute Plotly back-end to GAW**: deeper C/GObject work, less fun.
    
*   **Fresh Dash app (recommended)**: clean Python, flexible, no historical baggage.
    

Given your scripting habits and emphasis on **AI-assisted, notebook-friendly tooling**, a fresh Dash app is likely the **highest ROI**: you get exactly the UX you want, plus a live playground to prototype AI-driven waveform analyses later (auto-annotate settling time, automatically tag glitches, etc.).

* * *

### Verdict

**Yes, it’s a project worth doing**:

*   **Scope is small enough** (≈1 500 LOC) to finish solo in 1–2 months.
    
*   **Leverages your existing Python tooling** and maximises Copilot/GPT code assistance.
    
*   Produces a **sharable, browser-native viewer** that slots neatly into your AI-augmented design flow and Obsidian knowledge base.
    

Kick it off with a weekend spike: load a `.raw`, plot one trace in Dash, and wire up two cursor lines—you’ll know in a day whether the ergonomics click. Happy hacking!

## Prompt:
Generate a product requirement document (markdown format) for a MVP project with the python + dash stack we discussed. We will feed it to Cursor for implementation.

## Response:
```markdown
# MVP Product Requirements Document  
**Project Codename:** *WaveDash*  
**Last updated:** 23 May 2025  
**Author:** ChatGPT (drafted for Dr. Zhu)  

---

## 1 – Purpose & Vision
Design a lightweight, fully-open-source **web-based waveform viewer** that loads native **SPICE/Ngspice `.raw` files** and provides modern, Plotly-grade interactivity (zoom/pan at 60 fps, dual-cursor Δ-markers, simple math/FFT traces, HTML export).  
The viewer should slot seamlessly into Python-centric analog design flows, run locally or in a Docker container, and be easy to extend by AI code-assist tools (e.g., Cursor, Copilot, GPT-o3).

---

## 2 – Goals & Success Metrics
| KPI | Target for MVP |
|-----|----------------|
| **Time to first plot** (drag-&-drop → waveform rendered) | ≤ 3 s for a 10 MB `.raw` |
| **Interactivity FPS** (zoom/pan) | ≥ 55 fps on a 1080p trace with 1 M points after down-sampling |
| **Δ-cursor accuracy** | ± 1 sample (time) / ± 1 LSB (voltage) |
| **Standalone HTML size** | ≤ 4 MB (excluding original data) |
| **Unit-test coverage** | ≥ 80 % of Python backend |

Success = internal team adopts WaveDash for daily Ngspice debug & publishes at least one HTML shareable plot within 8 weeks.

---

## 3 – User Personas
1. **Analog IC Designer** (primary) – wants a quick, platform-agnostic viewer to debug bias ramps, transient glitches, FFT noise.  
2. **RF Systems Engineer** – needs cursor Δf, ΔV, and overlay of math traces (e.g., `Vout-Vin`).  
3. **Student / OSS Contributor** – runs on Windows or Mac, no privilege to install GTK apps.  

---

## 4 – User Stories (MVP)
| ID | As a… | I want to… | So that I can… | Priority |
|----|-------|------------|----------------|----------|
| U1 | Designer | Drag & drop a `.raw` file onto browser | instantly view all node traces | P0 |
| U2 | Designer | Toggle visibility of traces & change colors | focus on signals of interest | P0 |
| U3 | Designer | Place two vertical cursors and read Δt / ΔV | measure settling time / gain | P0 |
| U4 | Designer | Enter a math expression (`(V(out)-V(in))*1e3`) | derive differential or scaled signals | P1 |
| U5 | RF Eng | Switch to “Spectrum” tab | inspect FFT of selected trace | P1 |
| U6 | Student | Export the current view as a self-contained HTML file | share with classmates without extra tools | P1 |
| U7 | Designer | Launch viewer from CLI (`wavedash myfile.raw`) | integrate into scripts | P1 |

Out-of-scope for MVP: eye-diagrams, mixed-signal VCD import, automated glitch-finder, persistence storage of projects.

## 5 – Functional Requirements

### 5.1 File Handling
* Accept `.raw` (Spice3 binary & ASCII); reject with error toast otherwise.  
* Maximum tested size: 2 GB. Implement **on-load decimation** (keep ≤ 2 M points/trace).  
* Allow future extension for `.csv` & `.wav` via plugin.

### 5.2 Plot Engine
* **Plotly WebGL (`scattergl`)** traces; autoscale on load.  
* View controls: zoom, pan, autoscale, reset.

### 5.3 Dual-Cursor Measurement
* Two draggable vertical markers.  
* Display Δt, ΔY (ΔV / ΔI) in a fixed readout.  
* Snaps to nearest sample unless user holds **Shift** (free mode).

### 5.4 Math & Derived Traces
* Text input accepts Pythonic/NumExpr expressions referencing traces by name (`V(out)`, `I(R1)`).  
* Evaluated server-side; new trace added to list.

### 5.5 FFT Tab
* Window selector (Rectangular, Hanning).  
* Log-Mag (dBV) vs frequency plot; optional cursor readouts.

### 5.6 Share / Export
* **“Export HTML”** button: bundles Plotly JS, current layout, trace data (decimated) into one file.  
* **CLI** flag `--export` for headless generation.

### 5.7 CLI Wrapper
```

wavedash <file.raw> \[--port 8050\] \[--export out.html\]

````
Starts Dash server bound to localhost.

## Prompt:
I need some brain storming with the idea. Since we are already in a browser, then we are not limited by the vertical screen size since we can scroll through panels. I’m thinking about a UI with a sidebar that has a tree view of all the hierarchical signals from the raw file, and on the main column is a dashboard of different signals. 

I want to create visualizations into multiple tiles in the main column, not limited to waveform, but can also be a table of scaler data and operating points.

one key requirement is an API where we can automatically generate a dashboard layout without mouse clicks. 

We will support different export format later, but html is the most straightforward one and we can eembed them into other documentations which is nice.


# questions:
How is an interactive dashboard usually structured? Are there any best practice that are tried and tested?

Can I save the layout of the dashboard into a json file that we can reload later?

## Response:
Thought for 34 seconds

Below is a **design-ideas cheat-sheet** you can paste straight into your design notebook.  
It first sketches the _typical anatomy_ of an interactive dashboard, then maps that to a concrete **Dash-based implementation pattern**, and finally shows **how to persist / reload the layout as JSON** so the whole board can be recreated by code—no mouse required.

1 — Tried-and-tested dashboard structure
----------------------------------------

| Layer | Purpose | “What works” in real-world tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Navigation rail / sidebar** | Quick access to large signal sets or pages. | Tree view, collapsible groups, search filter. Dash users usually wrap a React tree (e.g. `rc-tree`) or embed **Dash AG Grid** in “column list” mode—both play nicely inside a fixed-width sidebar. [Plotly Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/how-to-create-a-collapsible-sidebar-with-tree-structure-of-uploaded-files/39989?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid/enterprise-sidebar?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Header bar (optional)** | Branding, file selector, dark-mode toggle. | Keep it 56–64 px high; avoid stuffing controls that belong to the sidebar. |
| **Main canvas / board** | Holds the _tiles_ (graphs, tables, spectra, …). | Best practice is a **responsive grid** where each tile knows _(x, y, w, h)_; users can drag/resize, but the same grid can also be generated programmatically. Tools like **react-grid-layout** (wrapped for Dash by `dash-draggable` or the newer **dash-dynamic-grid-layout**) are the standard way. [Plotly Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/new-component-dash-dynamic-grid-layout/86153?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/MehdiChelh/dash-draggable?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **State store** | Mirrors the current layout + tile metadata. | JSON blob held in `dcc.Store` (browser memory) and/or `localStorage`. Update it via the grid’s `onLayoutChange` callback so position changes are always captured. [Plotly Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/dash-responsive-grid-layout-layout-saved-on-local-storage/32204?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[STRML](https://strml.github.io/react-grid-layout/examples/8-localstorage-responsive.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

### UX guidelines worth copying

*   **Single scroll column** – Use vertical scrolling on the main canvas; keep sidebar and header fixed. Scrolling dashboards outperform deep nested tabs in usability tests. [Pencil & Paper](https://www.pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-data-dashboards?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Progressive disclosure** – Show only the 5–7 most relevant signals by default; everything else stays collapsed in the tree.
    
*   **Consistent tile grammar** – each tile gets a title, y-axis label, and a compact options menu in the same corner (Grafana, Kibana, Chronograf all follow this).
    
*   **Low-latency interactions** – move expensive data ops (FFT, decimation) to the Python side; keep the React front-end doing just rendering.

2 — Dash implementation blueprint
---------------------------------

```text
app.layout
└── dcc.Location (URL ↔ dashboard_id)
└── html.Div(class="sidebar")
│   └── dbc.Accordion / Dash AG Grid  ← signal tree
└── dcc.Store(id="layout-json", storage_type="local")  ← persistent model
└── DraggableGrid(id="grid")
    ├── Tile(id="wave1")  ← wrapper div
    │   └── dcc.Graph(figure=...)
    ├── Tile(id="op-table")
    │   └── dash_table.DataTable(data=...)
    └── ...
```

*   **`DraggableGrid`** is provided by `dash-dynamic-grid-layout` (or `dash-draggable`); it exposes `layout` and `onLayoutChange` exactly like `react-grid-layout`.
    
*   On app start you read the JSON from file / dcc.Store → build the list of `Tile` components (one `Tile` factory function = zero mouse clicks).
    
*   Every call to `onLayoutChange` updates `layout-json`, so refreshing the page restores the exact arrangement.
    

* * *

3 — JSON layout schema (suggested)
----------------------------------

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "grid": { "cols": 12, "rowHeight": 30, "margin": 4 },
  "tiles": [
    {
      "id": "wave1",
      "kind": "waveform",
      "signals": ["V(out)", "V(in)"],
      "layout": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 6, "h": 8 }
    },
    {
      "id": "op_table",
      "kind": "table",
      "source": "operating_point",
      "layout": { "x": 6, "y": 0, "w": 6, "h": 4 }
    },
    {
      "id": "fft1",
      "kind": "spectrum",
      "signals": ["V(out)"],
      "window": "hanning",
      "layout": { "x": 6, "y": 4, "w": 6, "h": 6 }
    }
  ]
}
```

_Everything needed to rebuild the board lives in one file_:  
positions, component type (`kind`), and data bindings (`signals` or `source`).

### Load / save flow

```python
# ----- load ----------
with open("dashboard.json") as f:
    cfg = json.load(f)
app.layout = build_layout(cfg)

# ----- save ----------
def on_layout_change(new_layout, current_cfg):
    current_cfg["tiles"] = merge_positions(current_cfg["tiles"], new_layout)
    return current_cfg         # returned into dcc.Store

@app.callback(Output("download", "data"), Input("save-btn", "n_clicks"),
              State("layout-json", "data"), prevent_initial_call=True)
def save_to_disk(_, cfg):
    return dcc.send_string(json.dumps(cfg, indent=2),
                           filename="dashboard.json")
```

4 — Answering your specific questions
-------------------------------------

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| **“How is an interactive dashboard usually structured?”** | Header + Sidebar for navigation, scrollable _grid canvas_ for content, persistent _state store_ for the model. Start with a 12-column responsive grid (Bootstrap & Grafana convention). Use drag-resizable tiles backed by a JSON model so mouse and code paths stay in sync. |
| **“Best practices?”** | _Separate layout from data_, keep the number of top-level nav controls small, favour vertical scroll over nested tabs, debounce expensive analytics, and persist the grid state on each change. UX research shows this layout reduces cognitive load and keeps interactions predictable. [Pencil & Paper](https://www.pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-data-dashboards?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **“Can I save and reload the layout as JSON?”** | Yes. Both `react-grid-layout` and its Dash wrappers emit the full position/size dict on every move. Capture it, dump to JSON (or `dcc.Store` → `localStorage`), and rebuild the grid from that dict on load. Numerous Dash examples already do this. [Plotly Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/dash-responsive-grid-layout-layout-saved-on-local-storage/32204?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[STRML](https://strml.github.io/react-grid-layout/examples/8-localstorage-responsive.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

* * *

### Next steps

1.  **Prototype** – throw `dash-dynamic-grid-layout` into a blank Dash app, hard-code three tiles, and verify the `layout` dict round-trips through `dcc.Store`.
    
2.  **Tree sidebar** – test a `dbc.Accordion` or `Dash AG Grid` instance bound to the raw-file signal list; clicking a node issues `add_tile(signal_id)` through a callback (no mouse positioning needed).
    
3.  **Define tile registry** – map `kind` → factory function returning a Dash component; keep that in its own Python module so extensions (e.g., eye-diagram) are one-liner plugins.
    

Follow that skeleton and you’ll have a _scroll-friendly, code-driven_ dashboard that is both pleasant for day-to-day probing and fully scriptable for batch testbench runs. Happy building!

## Prompt:
I need a name for the project.

## Response:
Here are some name ideas, each with a short rationale:

* * *

### **Clean & Descriptive**

| Name | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| **WaveDash** | Simple, combines _waveform_ + _Dash_; instantly conveys what it is. |
| **Spiceboard** | Like a dashboard for SPICE signals; memorable and intuitive. |
| **ScopeView** | Evokes an oscilloscope interface; clear and technical. |
| **SignalPanel** | Emphasizes the tiled dashboard layout. |
| **RawScope** | Refers directly to SPICE `.raw` files + scope functionality. |

* * *

### **Short & Catchy**

| Name | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| **Siggy** | Friendly, mascot-ready, short for “signal viewer.” |
| **VizSpice** | Clear mashup: _visualization_ + _SPICE_. |
| **Scopey** | Cute and playful; fits if the project is dev-focused. |
| **Voltio** | A stylized nod to voltage + dashboard; could have personality. |
| **Pulsar** | Evokes pulses/signals, clean and futuristic. |

* * *

### **Developer-oriented**

| Name | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| **PlotCraft** | Appeals to builders—like StarCraft but for plotting. |
| **Wavelet** | Nods to waveforms, small footprint, also a signal processing term. |
| **TraceFrame** | Emphasizes signal trace viewing in a flexible frame layout. |

* * *

Would you prefer a name that feels **professional and clean**, or something **playful and developer-friendly**? I can refine based on your tone and audience.
